# Airfoil Morphing Tool
This MATLAB live code tool can be used to morph any given airfoil with user-defined flap and slat settings. 
Two types of flaps and slats can be generated using this tool - ***Hinged*** and ***Continuous***

#### INSTRUCTIONS TO USE THE TOOL
1. The airfoil file should be in the *(\*.dat)* extension
2. Add the input airfoil file location in the FileName variable ***with extension***.
3. The Contour signifies if the Flap or Slat is going to be ***hinged*** or ***continuous***. <br/>

4. The users have three options to switch between Flap modification, Slat modification or both combined.
5. The input data requires the hinge position in terms of Chord percentage and Thickness percentage depending on the type of modification.
6. You can rename the output file name but it should be in the *(\*.dat)* extension.
